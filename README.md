# System Requirements
This project is currently been built on codeigniter latest framework and at thus requires a server running PHP version 7.2 or higher. Also a MySql database on the server is necessary for data storage

# Installation
- Rename the file '.env_example' on the root directory to '.env'. This file would hold the configuration settings of your application until you maybe decide to store the configurations on a database instead
- Uncomment the "# app.baseURL = ''" option and match the value with your current domain name & protocol
- Create your database on your server and then import the file 'db.sql' found also on the root directory of this project. This creates the necessary tables the project need to function
- Update your .env file under the database option to reflect your server database configuration. Don't forget to uncomment each line
- Still on your .env file at the Auth config option,put in the username you wish to use to login everytime and pasword. Password must be a sha1 string. Though,this wont be used when logging in
